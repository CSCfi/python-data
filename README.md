# CSC's Python and Data Science course

This repository contains material and course pages for CSC's Data Analysis
with Python course.

## Practices

This repository is (and should be) private to the CSC organization for now. It
is for storing work in progress for now and complete notebooks in the future. 

A requirements.txt should contain all the requirements for all the modules for
an easy building of a blueprint (similar) to run the notebooks.

To publish a notebook curate away the fill-in-yourself parts (could we
automate this) to a pared down version and copy the version to
assets/notebooks under gh-pages branch, link to it on the course site and
publish changes.
