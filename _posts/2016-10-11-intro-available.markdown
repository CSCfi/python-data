To access the notebook navigate to [Pouta Blueprints](https://pb.csc.fi/) and
log in using Haka authentication.

Once logged in, start an instance of the Jupyter Notebook container

![Jupyter notebook]({{ "/assets/img/instructions/pb_jupyter_notebook.png" | prepend:site.baseurl }})

Wait for a while until you can 

![Open in browser]({{ "/assets/img/instructions/pb_open_in_browser.png" | prepend:site.baseurl }})

Then start a new terminal 

![New Terminal]({{ "/assets/img/instructions/jupyter_new_terminal.png" | prepend:site.baseurl }})

And run

        # wget \
        https://csc-it-center-for-science.github.io/python-data/assets/notebooks/intro.ipynb

In the terminal. Go back to the Jupyter notebook view. You may have to press
the refresh button in the corner.

Finally when you click on the name of the file Jupyter will open the notebook
for you.

![Downloaded File]({{ "/assets/img/instructions/pb_downloaded_file.png" | prepend:site.baseurl }})

In the end you should see this view and be able to access the tutorial.
![Downloaded File]({{ "/assets/img/instructions/jupyter_intro.png" | prepend:site.baseurl }})

**remember everything you do will be wiped out after the container is closed!**
